  Black women have been continuously mistreated over the course of recorded history— that is a fact. Libraries are filled with newspaper clippings of upcoming slave auctions describing captives as “young and fertile house servants” right next to the selling of livestock. There are medical files of sexual violence by white male doctors under the name of medical advancement. Social scientific journals describe the “moral depravity” of ghettos in the metropolitan hubs of the 1920s and 30s, which only hold evidence of being riddled with racial superiority. Together, I want to think about this historical evidence as constitutive of particular archive practice. These archival practices regarding Black women continue to be dubious and uphold racial biases, stereotypes, and aggressions that haunt Black bodies.
	Diverse forms of archival media, including television, become vehicles through which Black women are harmed. The intersection of Black women and the screen is precarious and problematic. We have taken many forms in recorded visual media— Jezebel, the Mammy, the Sapphire, the best friend, the ho. Living in what Saidiya Hartman coins as the  “afterlife of slavery,” every inch of global culture is touched by the trans-Atlantic slave trade; therefore, it touches television, and even more specficially, reality television (RTV), as a reproduction of the visual cutlure of Black life.
